reference.faidx=The reference sequence as a FASTA file and indexed with samtools faidx. 
file.tabix=The file must be compressed with bgzip and indexed with tabix.
max.records.in.ram=When writing data that need to be sorted, this will specify the number of records  stored in RAM before spilling to disk. Increasing this number reduces the number of file  handles needed to sort a SAM file, and increases the amount of RAM needed.
add.tmp.dir=Add a temporary directory.
illegal.number.of.arguments=Illegal number of arguments. Check your options, check the number of input.
reference.undefined=The Fasta Reference file has not been defined.
not.the.same.sequence.dictionaries=Sam Sequence Dictionaries are not the same.
chrom.missing.in.sequence.dictionary=A chromosome is missing from the SAMSequenceDictionary.
chrom.name.helper= chrom name file helper (name1)(tab2)(name2)
capure.bed=Capture bed.
bed.interval0=The genomic region (chromosome:start-end) 
bed.interval0.undefined=The genomic region (chromosome:start-end) was not defined
known.genes.tabix=Known Gene File Indexed with tabix.
known.genes.uri=UCSC KnownGene URI . e.g: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/knownGene.txt.gz
berkeley.db.home=Directory for storing data in a BerkeleyDB database ( http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/berkeleydb/overview/index.html )
picard.dictionary.needed=The reference file must be indexed with Picard CreateSequenceDictionary ( http://picard.sourceforge.net/command-line-overview.shtml#CreateSequenceDictionary ) and saved as, e.g. 'reference.dict'.
cannot.load.mysql.driver=You have not set the mysql-connector in your path. The appropriate java database  driver ( the MySQL jdbc driver) has not been installed. See : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/thirdparty-095608.html
fastq.paired.read.missing=Not same number of reads between two fastq files
file.is.missing.dict=The input file is missing a SAM sequence dictionary.
no.sample.in.vcf=The VCF doesn't contain any sample
no.dict.in.vcf=The VCF doesn't contain a SequenceDictionary ('contig' line in header) . Use picard http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#UpdateVcfSequenceDictionary to add one
vcf.must.have.only.one.sample=The VCF file should contain one and only one sample.
